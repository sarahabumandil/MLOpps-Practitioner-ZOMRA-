"""The metrics store: drift results, late labels, deploys and retrain decisions.

Why SQLite and not Postgres. ``docker-compose.yaml`` runs Prometheus + Grafana,
and six more containers behind the ``langfuse`` profile. A seventh container
just to hold four small tables would break the stack budget for a lesson that is
about *keeping* the numbers, not about which engine keeps them.

Why keep them at all, when Prometheus is right there: Prometheus is a 15-day
ring buffer of *time series*. "Which features drifted against which frozen
reference, in the window ending Tuesday" is a *fact with provenance*, and the
retrain gate (jobs/retrain_gate.py) has to be able to ask it about last month.
That is a database question. This is the smallest thing that answers it.

Read it from the command line during an incident — RUNBOOK.md step 4 uses these:

    sqlite3 -header -column metrics_store.db \\
      "select ts, component, version from deploys order by ts desc limit 5;"
