"""Replay ride traffic against the model API, honouring whatever is broken.

    python -m tools.traffic                    # normal, ~20 rps, runs until Ctrl-C
    python -m tools.traffic --rps 40 --seconds 60
    python -m tools.traffic --profile ramadan  # or let incident 06 set it

The generator is where three incidents actually live, because three of them are
UPSTREAM failures — the API is innocent and its own metrics look fine:

  01  FEED_DISTANCE_IN_MILES   sends miles in a field the API reads as km
  05  NEW_CITY_ROLLOUT         ~8% of trips start arriving from alexandria
  06  TRAFFIC_PROFILE=ramadan  demand moves into the hours before iftar

It also closes the label loop: a share of requests come back later with the
true duration via /feedback, which is what MAE, the drift-vs-accuracy
comparison and incident 15 all depend on.
