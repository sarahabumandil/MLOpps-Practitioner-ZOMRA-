"""
Plain FastAPI, annotated — the CONTROL in the serving benchmark.

This file deliberately serves the SAME model, with the SAME response contract,
as `bentoml_example.py`. The only difference is everything a serving framework
would have given you for free. Each of those is marked below with the same
`# [N] …` numbering `bentoml_example.py` uses, so the two files read side by
side:

    1. Dynamic batching      NOT HERE — batch size is always 1, provably
    2. Request queueing      NOT HERE — no admission control, no queue timeout
    3. Pre/post-processing   present — pydantic in, derived fields out
    4. Model versioning      BARELY HERE — a string resolved once at startup
    5. Concurrency control   present, but only as "whatever the threadpool does"

The point of running both is that [1], [2] and [4] stop being slide bullets and
become numbers: hit `/metrics` after a load test and `avg_batch_size` is still
`1.0`, no matter how many concurrent callers you threw at it.

NOTE ON THE WIRE FORMAT: unlike the BentoML service, `/predict` here takes and
returns a FLAT object — there is no `{"inputs": [...]}` envelope and no
one-element array, because there is no batching to address. The *fields* are
identical, so one client can parse either server's rows; only the envelope
differs. `locustfile.py` encodes exactly that difference.
